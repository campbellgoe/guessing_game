Guess a number between 1 and 1000.

See https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html

This is my second rust program (after hello world). It was quite satisfying to write some rust code for the first time.

Extra to the tutorial in [Chapter 2](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html)
this program tells the player how many guesses they made to reach the correct answer. They can also exit by typing `q` or `quit`.

You could build this program and run it yourself in a command line terminal by [installing rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html) and using `cargo run`.
